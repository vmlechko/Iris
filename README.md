# Iris

Cross-border support that the recipient can see coming.

*Iris carried messages between worlds along a rainbow bridge — and an iris is also
the part of the eye. Both halves of the name are the product: a bridge across a
border, entered with a glance.*

Instead of a one-off transfer, the sender creates a **commitment** — "$200 on the 5th,
every month". The money is reserved up front and the recipient sees the confirmed
commitment and a countdown *before* it arrives. The receiving side never installs an
app, never sees a seed phrase, and never needs gas: they open a link, use Face ID, and
the amount is shown in their own currency.

Built for **Monad Metropolis 2026** — Track 02, Consumer Products & Payments.

## Status

Early. Currently validating the account architecture before building the product.

- [x] Project scaffold
- [ ] **Spike: EIP-7702 sponsored gas for a zero-balance account** ← blocking
- [ ] Mera passkey onboarding in the browser
- [ ] Commitment escrow contract
- [ ] Recipient flow
- [ ] Sender flow

## Stack

- **Monad testnet** (chain `10143`)
- **[Mera](https://docs.monad.xyz/guides/mera)** (`@category-labs/mera`) — passkey accounts, the entire account layer. No seed phrase, no extension.
- **EIP-7702** — the recipient's EOA gains smart-contract behaviour and a sponsor pays gas, so a zero-balance account can claim.
- **AUSD** (Agora) — settlement asset. `earnAUSD` for funds in flight.
- **Next.js + Serwist** (PWA) — mobile experience, opened from a link.
- **viem**, **Solidity**

## The open question

Monad prevents a *delegated* EOA from dropping below a 10 MON reserve. Our recipient
holds exactly 0 MON. `scripts/spike-7702.ts` answers whether that restriction blocks a
sponsored call from an empty account. Everything else waits on the answer.

## Running the spike

```bash
npm install
npm run compile
npm run spike:7702      # prints a sponsor address to fund on first run
```

Fund the printed address at [faucet.monad.xyz](https://faucet.monad.xyz), then run it again.

## Verified on-chain (5 Sep 2026)

AUSD on Monad testnet — `0xa9012a055bd4e0eDfF8Ce09f960291C09D5322dC`

| | |
|---|---|
| symbol | `AUSD` |
| **decimals** | **6** — not 18 |
| EIP-712 | `DOMAIN_SEPARATOR()` present |
| ERC-2612 | `nonces()` present |
| **ERC-3009** | **`authorizationState()` present** — gasless transfers by signature |

`npm run probe:ausd` re-runs the check.

ERC-3009 means neither side needs to hold gas for the money to move: the sender signs
`transferWithAuthorization` off-chain and a relayer submits it. Combined with the fact
that scheduled payouts are *pushed* by a keeper, the recipient never signs anything to
receive funds — only to spend them.
